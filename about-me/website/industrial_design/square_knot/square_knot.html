		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>
			Create a table with as many legs as you have partners in your team. Each teammate must create a part of the tabletop and a leg and make sure it fits together.

		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>
			To create a natural looking table that can be easily stored and shipped.

		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<p>
			Once we researched different types and styles of tables, we came up with our designs. After multiple iterations and discussions, we came up with this design for our table. Seeking an organic yet structurally sound design, we finalized our design by laminating veneer in order to attain a woven look.

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>
			Initially, we made cardboard prototypes before building a full scale model. Once we began building the full scale model, we had to create 2 molds for the 2 shapes. Using whatever materials we could find, we built these molds.
