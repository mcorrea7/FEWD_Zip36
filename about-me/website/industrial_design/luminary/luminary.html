		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>
			How can I create an effective ambient light that is conducive for a working environment and minimizes the side effects of working late?

		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>
			By creating a light that adapts to the amount of light in a room at any given time (ultimately reducing overstimulation to blue light), a working environment can be less harmful to one's health.
		</p>

		<h3>Key Insights</h3>
		<p>
			Cool Light

			Melatonin Disruption - An excess of cool light decreases melatonin production and causes delays in circadian rhythms (sleep cycles)

			Eye Strain - Overexposure cool light causes retinal fatigue and long-term damage

			Warm Light

			Melatonin Production - Exposure facilitates circadian rhythms and increases the production of melatonin, making a person feel sleepy and tired.

			Warmth - Warm light has been associated with the warmth of a fire, providing a sense of security and a creates a welcoming feeling

		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<p>
			By creating a lighting system, the dispersal of light will be optimal. With the use of ambient light sensors and GPS tracking, the color temperature and brightness of the light should be able to automatically adjust. Coincidentally, the light can be manually adjust via a phone application.
