		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>
			The ca.gov website has many great resources that are very hard to find due to the current layout. The visual hierharchy is lacking and if a user is on the site, there is no guidance if he or she isn't sure of what they are searching for.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<p>
			The current <a href="ca.gov">ca.gov</a> website doesn't guide the user to a specific area to begin a search, so if a user doesn't have something in particular to search for, he or she might get lost on the homepage. In my version of the website, my goal was to guide the user to use the drop down menu to facilitate an easier search and experience. If a user didn't feel like using the "mad lib" form, then he or she could browse programs by category or by directly searching in the top right corner.

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>
			After wireframing an endless amount, paper prototypes, I incorporated the culmination of ideas into Sketch, and then exported them to Invision.

		<h3>Final Prototype</h3>
		<p>
			Once everything was laid out on Sketch, I went to testing and iterating on parts that seemed disconnected, ultimately ending up with the prototype below.
